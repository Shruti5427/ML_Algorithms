# Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Repository! 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to this collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** in Python. Whether you’re just starting your ML journey or looking to refine your skills, this repo has got you covered. It’s structured to be super beginner-friendly, and all the code follows best practices. 💡

## 📚 What's Inside?

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
   - **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Classification model for binary/multiclass problems.
   - **Decision Tree**: Build decision trees for classification & regression.
   - **Random Forest**: Enhance decision trees with ensemble learning.
   - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Find the best separating hyperplane.
   - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classify based on the majority vote of neighbors.
   - **Naive Bayes**: A simple but effective probabilistic classifier.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Group similar data into K clusters.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Build a tree of clusters.
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduce dimensions of data.
   - **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering algorithm.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning technique.
   - **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Combine deep learning with Q-learning.

## 🔧 How to Get Started

If you want to dive right in, here’s how you can get up and running:

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-algorithms.git
   cd ml-algorithms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and then run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Pick an algorithm**:  
   Find an algorithm that piques your interest and run it! For example, to run linear regression:  
   ```bash
   python supervised/linear_regression.py
   ```

That’s it! The code is ready for you to explore and experiment with.
